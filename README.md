# k8s-handson

In this project, we discuse and practise real-world kubernetes works, 
from scratch to advanced. So, we divie our project into three sections:


|- **Primary Level**  
|-- define a simple pod  
|-- define a simlpe service  
|-- define a simlpe namespace  
|-- define a simlpe deploy  
|  
|  
|- **Intermediate Level**  
|-- define a small project deployment  
|-- consider deploying for two environments: dev, prod  
|  
|  
|- **Advanced Level**  
|-- implement a complicated project in diffrent environments  
|-- using configMap in our project  
|-- using helm chart to deploy
